// to run redux we need to install two packages from the official https://redux.js.org/ website (do not mix with any other sites with similar namings)
// from Getting Started menu we need to install:
//! 1. <npm install @reduxjs/toolkit> and below it
//! 2. <npm install react-redux> // this second package links redux with react
// than within src folder we create folder and call it either stores or redux
// as we are using routers here we still need to run here <npm install react-router-dom>

//! also we need to our Google Chrome Redux DevTools extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd by clicking Add to Chrome button

// action, reducer are used syncronic tasks, while for asyncronic tasks it is recommended to use extraReducers()
